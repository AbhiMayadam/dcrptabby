# Tabby

NUI Tablet for FiveM Servers for anyone to use. You may add to the tablet for your needs but by no means is it to be re-released without my permission.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your server for production use.

### Prerequisites

You should already have a functioning FiveM Server set up and running before you can install this mod.
Basic HTML experience.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get the tablet up and running on your server.

    1.) Place the "tab" folder under your resources folder in your fiveM server files.

    2.) Add "start tab" to your server config file.

    3.) Either restart your server or use the /refresh then /start tab command.

### Usage

* "M" key to open tablet.

* "ESC" to close the tablet and leave it on the page you were on next time it opens.

* The tablet button on the bottom of the tablet will bring you back to the homescreen with one click and then click it again to close.

* Hover over an app to see a description of it. Select the app you wish to open.

* To edit the webpages you'll need to find the page you wish to edit (the actually html page in the files). I have left templates from my old server in there to help you with ideas and things to add in. For your CAD/MDT make sure you add your address in the iframe correctly on the opencad.html page.
